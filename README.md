# Flymon

A WordPress plugin to display the lowest travel prices for given routes/dates in your blog.  
Powers the flight price monitor here: https://escapefromberl.in

## Installation

Copy the plugin folder `flightprices-monitor` into the plugins directory; activate.  
Open Settings -> Flymon and add your Kiwi.com API key + affiliate id for deeplinks.

## Usage

To display the price in your post or page, insert the shortcode `trip_price` in the paragraph.  

**Shortcode parameters & examples (+ default values):**
-   from: BER, berlin\_de (required)
-   to: MUC, innsbruck\_at (required)
-   earliest: 2022-01-30, tomorrow (now)
-   latest: 2022-12-31, +2 weeks (now + 3 months)
-   min\_days (7)
-   max\_days (14)
-   max\_stops (0)
-   transport: aircraft, bus, train -- comma-separated (aircraft)
-   currency (EUR)
-   locale (en)

For locations, use IATA codes or check out [Kiwi's locations API](https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/docs/tequila_api/locations_api).
For dates, you can use a wide range of expressions -- whatever can be parsed by PHP's [`strtotime()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php).

Examples:
```
[trip_price from="BER" to="MUC" earliest="tomorrow" latest="+6 months" currency="EUR"]
[trip_price from="LON" to="IST" earliest="+1 week" latest="+1 month" min_days="6" max_days="8" currency="GBP"]
[trip_price from="AMS" to="PAR" latest="+3 months" min_days="2" max_days="3" transport="train,bus"]
[trip_price from="NYC" to="TYO" transport="bus"]
```
